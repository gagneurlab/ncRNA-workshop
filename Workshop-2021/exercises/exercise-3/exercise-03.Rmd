# Setup

```{r, config, echo = T}
library(ggplot2)
library(data.table)
library(magrittr)   # Needed for %>% operator
library(tidyr)
```


# Choosing the appropriate visualization method

Match each chart type with the relationship it shows best.

1. shows distribution and quantiles, especially useful when comparing distributions.
2. highlights individual values, supports comparison, can show rankings or deviations
categories and totals
3. shows overall changes and patterns, usually over time
4. shows relationship between two quantitative variables.

Options: bar chart, line chart, scatterplot, boxplot

```{r}
# 1. boxplot
# 2. bar chart
# 3. line chart
# 4. scatterplot
```

# Getting to know your dataset

`Iris` is a classical and widely used dataset in machine learning literature. It was first introduced by R.A. Fisher in his 1936 paper. Load the \textit{iris} data into your R environment. What is the dimension of the dataset? What kind of data type does each column has? How many Species does it contain?


```{r fig.width=2, fig.height=2, echo=FALSE, eval=T, fig.align='center'}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG("~/R_workshop/ncRNA-workshop/Workshop-2020/assets/img/lec03_iris.png")
grid.raster(img)
```


```{r}
# Solution
dim(iris)
head(iris)
sapply(iris, class)
## iris %>% as.data.table %>% .[, .N, by=Species]
table(iris$Species)
```

# Data exploration

How are the lengths and widths of sepals and petals distributed? How would you visualize them? `Hint: tidy the data set and facet_wrap()`.

```{r }
# Solution
iris_melt <- melt(iris, id.var=c("Species"))

head(iris_melt)

ggplot(data = iris_melt, aes(x = value)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  facet_wrap( ~ variable)
```


# Misleading plots

1) Visualize the lengths and widths of the sepals and petals from the iris data with boxplots. 
2) Add jitter (`geom_jitter()`) to visualize all points. Discuss: in this case, why is it not good to visualize the data with boxplots?
3) Alternatives to boxplot are violin plots (`geom_violin()`) and beanplots (`geom_beeswarm()` from library `ggbeeswarm`. Install it with `install.packages("ggbeeswarm")`). Apply both options to the same data. 
4) Which pattern shows up when moving from boxplot to violin/bean plot? Give possible explanations for it. How could you prove your theories graphically?


```{r}
# Solution
library(ggbeeswarm)

# 1)
ggplot(iris_melt, aes(variable, value)) +
  geom_boxplot() 

# 2)
ggplot(iris_melt, aes(variable, value)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  geom_jitter(width = 0.3, size = .5)
# petal distributions are bimodal, boxplot cannot visualize this property.

# 3)
ggplot(iris_melt, aes(variable, value)) +
  geom_violin() +
  geom_boxplot(width=0.03) # Overlay boxplot to visualize median can interquartile range.

ggplot(iris_melt, aes(variable, value)) +
  geom_beeswarm(size=0.5)

# 4) The difference in the measurements might be due to the Species
ggplot(iris_melt, aes(variable, value, color = Species)) +
  geom_beeswarm(size=0.5)
```

# Enchancing plots

Below is a graph taken from a published paper. Read the figure legend.

1) Discuss good and bad graphical properties of the plot. Make suggestions on how to improve it.

2) Implement a better visualization. As the original data is not available, we use the data simulated with the code below (also uploaded to Moodle).

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6, echo=FALSE, eval=T, fig.pos="H"}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG("~/R_workshop/ncRNA-workshop/Workshop-2020/assets/img/lec07_quast2013_slc_fig2.png")
grid.raster(img)
# ![Quast et al 2013, Plos ONE, Fig2](assets/img/lec07_quast2013_slc_fig2.png)
```




```{r}
# GOOD
# - simple design
# - not too many colors
# - clear labels
# - no chart junk
# - horizontal grid
# 
# BAD
# - no highlight, e.g. by color
# - x-axis not sorted
# - summary by mean+sd hides the data, which is at most four points per bar
# 
# Suggestion
# - plot single points instead of bars, with small median line (too few points for boxplot)
# - sort Mutants by median 
# - give color for above and below WT
```

```{r echo=T, message=FALSE}
# simulate data
dt <- data.table(pro_uptake = c(
  rnorm(3, 10100, 300), rnorm(4, 12100, 300), rnorm(3, 9850, 300), 
  rnorm(4, 11100, 300), rnorm(4,8300, 300), rnorm(3,10050, 300), 
  rnorm(3, 12000, 300), rnorm(3, 10020, 300), rnorm(3, 10080, 300),
  rnorm(3, 10070, 300)),
  mutants = c(rep('WT',3), rep('T49A',4), rep('K227N',3), rep('A400V',4),
              rep('L421P',4), rep('I500T',3), rep('N591D',3), rep('A601T',3),
              rep('E684D',3), rep('G710R',3) )
)
```

```{r, results='hide'}
# sort by median
dt[, median_per_mut := median(pro_uptake), by = mutants]
wt_med = unique(dt[mutants == 'WT', median_per_mut])
dt[, mutants:= factor(mutants, levels=unique(dt[order(median_per_mut), mutants]))]

# assign class by relation to WT, useful to give color
dt[, rel_to_wt := ifelse(median_per_mut < wt_med, 'Smaller than WT', 'Larger than WT'), 
   by = mutants]
dt[mutants == 'WT', rel_to_wt := 'WT']
```

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
ggplot(dt, aes(mutants, pro_uptake, fill = rel_to_wt)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.4) +
  labs(y = "Proline Uptake") + theme_bw() + scale_fill_ptol()
```


```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
## Another solution with bar plot:

summary_dt <- dt[, .(mean = mean(pro_uptake),
                     sd = sd(pro_uptake)),
                 by = "mutants"]
x_order <- summary_dt[order(mean), mutants]
summary_dt[, mutants := factor(mutants, levels = x_order)]
dt[, mutants := factor(mutants, levels = x_order)]
# get wt mean
wt <- summary_dt[mutants == "WT", mean]
# group mutants to larger and smaller than wt
summary_dt[, color := ifelse(mean > wt, "Larger", 
                             ifelse(mean == wt, "WT", "smaller"))]

ggplot(summary_dt) +
  geom_bar(aes(mutants, mean, fill = color), stat='identity') +
  geom_errorbar(aes(mutants, ymax=mean+sd, ymin=mean-sd), width = 0.2) +
  geom_jitter(data = dt, aes(mutants, pro_uptake)) + theme_bw() + scale_fill_ptol()

```

## Data analysis

Read the `titanic.csv` file. You can read description of the dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). 
Did age play a role in determining survival? Visualize this with a boxplot. 

Now use facets to visualize whether age and gender combined were factors in survival. Do the same for age and passenger class. 

Finally, visualize the interaction of age, gender and passenger class in determining survival.


```{r}
## Load data
titanic <- fread("~/R_workshop/ncRNA-workshop/Workshop-2020/extdata/titanic.csv")
titanic

## Did age play a role?
ggplot(titanic, aes(factor(survived), age)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.3, alpha = .3)

## Interaction between age and gender
ggplot(titanic, aes(factor(survived), age)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.3, alpha = .3) +
  facet_wrap(~ sex)

## Interaction between age and class
ggplot(titanic, aes(factor(survived), age)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.3, alpha = .3) +
  facet_wrap(~ pclass)

## Interaction between age, gender and class
ggplot(titanic, aes(factor(survived), age)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.3, alpha = .3) +
  facet_grid(pclass~ sex)

```
