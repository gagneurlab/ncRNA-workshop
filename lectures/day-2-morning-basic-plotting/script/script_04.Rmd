## Why plotting?

With the increasing amounts of data, it’s become increasingly difficult to manage and make sense of it all. It becomes nearly impossible for a single person to go through data line-by-line and see distinct patterns and make observations. In this context, data visualization becomes crucial for gaining insight into data that traditional descriptive statistics cannot. For instance, plotting can give hints about bugs in our code (or even in the data!) and can help us to develop and improve methods and models.

Do you see a pattern in these plots?

<!-- ![Random datasets](../assets/img/missleading-data-1.png){#id .class width=400px height=400px} -->
```{r, out.width = "200px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/img/missleading-data-1.png")
```

Maybe now?

<!-- ![Datasaurus tex](../assets/img/missleading-data-2.png){#id .class width=400px height=400px} -->

```{r, out.width = "200px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/img/missleading-data-2.png")
```

Well all those plots, including the infamous datasaurus, actually share the same statistics!

<!-- ![Same statistics, different datasets](../assets/img/missleading-data.png){#id .class width=200px height=200px} -->

```{r, out.width = "100px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/img/missleading-data.png")
```

When only looking at the statistics, we would have probably wrongly assumed that the datasets were identical. This illustration highlights why it is important to visualize data and not just rely on descriptive statistics.

We can consider another example given by a vector `height` containing (hypothetical) height measurements for 500 adults in Germany:

```{r echo=F}
set.seed(0)
height <- c(rnorm(499, mean=1.73, sd=0.045), 165)
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
length(height)
head(height, n=20)
```

Calculating the mean height returns the following output:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
mean(height)
```

Wait... what?

What happened? 

Assuming that adults in Germany are actually not exceptionally tall, we can plot the data for investigating this situation.

```{r out.width=c('250px', '250px'), fig.show='hold'}
plot(height)
hist(height)
```

Interestingly, there is an outlier in our data! One particular person seems to have a height above 150 meters that it is obviously wrong. As a result, it inflates our mean giving us the false impression that Germans are exceptionally tall.

A quick way to fix our dataset is to remove our outlier.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
fheight <- height[height < 3]
```

Now our plotted data seems more realistic and the mean hight makes sense.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
mean(fheight)
```

```{r out.width=c('250px', '250px'), fig.show='hold'}
plot(fheight)
hist(fheight)
```

## Grammar of graphics

Plotting with the help of the package `ggplot2` has become widely used by R programmers. The plotting logic of `ggplot2` is known as the grammar of graphics. The grammar of graphics is a visualization theory developed by Leland Wilkinson in 1999. It has influenced the development of graphics and visualization libraries alike and is based on 3 key principles:

* Separation of data from aesthetics (e.g. x and y-axis, color-coding)
* Definition of common plot/chart elements (e.g. scatter plots, box-plots, etc.)
* Composition of these common elements (one can combine elements as layers)

Now let's try to create a sophisticated example based on the R package `ggplot2` for visualizing the relationship of between the per-capita GDP `gdpPercap` and the life expectancy at birth `lifeExp` for every country from the dataset `gapminder`. We want to compare this relationship for the years 1977 and 2007:

```{r lec02_plt1}
#install.packages('gapminder')
library(gapminder)
gm_dt <- as.data.table(gapminder)[year %in% c(1977, 2007)]

ggplot(data=gm_dt, aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color=continent, size=pop)) +
  facet_grid(~year) + scale_x_log10() +
  labs(x="Life expectation at birth", y="per-capita GDP") + mytheme
```

We may, for instance, use such visualization to find differences in the life expectancy of each country and each continent.

Now... how do we create such a sophisticated plot step by step? First, we will introduce the major components of the grammar of graphics that will allow us to create and understand the previous example.


### Major components of the grammar of graphics

The following components are considered in the context of the grammar of graphics:

**Data:** `data.table` (or `data.frame`) object where columns correspond to variables

**Aesthetics:** visual characteristics that represent data (`aes`)
 - e.g. position, size, color, shape, transparency, fill

**Layers:** geometric objects that represent data (`geom_`)
 - e.g. points, lines, polygons, ...

**Scales:** for each aesthetic, describes how visual characteristic is converted to display values (`scale_`)
 - e.g. log scales, color scales, size scales, shape scales, ...

**Facets:** describes how data is split into subsets and displayed as multiple subgraphs (`facet_`)

**Stats:** statistical transformations that typically summarize data (`stat`)
 - e.g. counts, means, medians, regression lines, ...
 
**Coordinate system:** describes 2D space that data is projected onto (`coord_`)
 - e.g. Cartesian coordinates, polar coordinates, map projections, ...


<!-- ![A representation of the abstraction of grammar of graphics](../assets/img/pyramid-of-graphics.png){#id .class width=400px height=400px} -->
The following illustration represents the abstraction of grammar of graphics: 

```{r, out.width = "500px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/img/pyramid-of-graphics.png")
```

### Defining the data and layers

In our example, we consider the `gapminder` dataset, which serves as the data component of our visualization. First, we have a quick look at the data. We want to plot the variable `lifeExp` against the variable `gdpPercap` so we better have a look at the first lines of the data:

```{r lec02_plt}
head(gm_dt[, .(country, continent, gdpPercap, lifeExp, year)])
```

For starting with the visualization we initiate a `ggplot` object which generates a plot with background:

```{r}
ggplot()
```

Next, we can define the data to be plotted, which needs to be a `data.table` (or `data.frame`) object and the `aes()` function. This `aes()` function defines which columns in the `data.table` object map to `x` and `y` coordinates and if they should be colored or have different shapes and sizes based on the values in a different column. These elements are called “aesthetic” elements, which we observe in the plot. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = gm_dt, aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp))  
```

As we can see, we obtain a plot with labeled axis and ranges. We want to visualize the data with a simple **scatter plot**. In a scatter plot, the values of two variables are plotted along two axes. Each pair of values is represented as a point. In R, a scatter plot can be plotted with `ggplot2` using the function `geom_ponit`. We want to construct a scatter plot containing the `gdpPercap` on the x-axis and the `lifeExp` on the y-axis. For this we combine the function `geom_point()` to the previous line of code with the operator `+`:

```{r}
ggplot(data = gm_dt, aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp)) + geom_point()
```

One of the advantages of plotting with `ggplot` is that it returns an object which can be stored (e.g. in a variable called `p`). The stored object can be further edited in the future.


```{r lec02_plt7}
p <- ggplot(data = gm_dt, aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp)) + geom_point()
```

For instance, we can inspect the names of elements of the stored object with `names()`:

```{r}
names(p)
```

We can also save the `ggplot` object with the help of the function `saveRDS()`. Then, we can read the saved object again with the help of the function `readRDS()` and add a horizontal line at `y=50` to the plot:

```{r lec02_plt8}
saveRDS(p, "extdata/my_first_plot.rds")
p <- readRDS("extdata/my_first_plot.rds")
p + geom_hline(yintercept = 50)
```



### Mapping of aesthetics

#### Mapping of color, shape and size

We can easily map variables to different colors, sizes or shapes depending on the value of the specified variable. For assigning each point to its corresponding continent, we can define the variable `continent` as the `color` attribute in `aes()` as follows:

```{r}
ggplot(data = gm_dt, aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp, color=continent)) + geom_point()
```

American `color` or British `colour` are both acceptable as the argument specification.

Instead of color, we can also use different shapes for characterizing the different continents in the scatter plot. For this we specify the `shape` argument in `aes()` as follows:

```{r}
ggplot(data = gm_dt, aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp, shape=continent)) + geom_point()
```

Additionally, we distinguish the population of each country by giving a size to the points in the scatter plot: 

```{r}
ggplot(data = gm_dt, aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp, color=continent, size=pop)) +
  geom_point()
```


#### Global versus individual mapping

Mapping of aesthetics in `aes()` can be done globally or at individual layers.

For instance, in the previous plot we define the variables `gdpPercap` and `lifeExp` in the `aes()` function inside `ggplot()` for a **global** definition. Global mapping is inherited by default to all geom layers (`geom_point` in the previous example), while mapping at **individual** layers is only recognized at that layer. For example, we define the `aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp)` globally, but the color attributes only locally for the layer `geom_point`:

```{r lec02_plt5}
ggplot(data = gm_dt, aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color=continent, size=pop))
```

It is important to remark that individual layer mapping cannot be recognized by other layers. For instance, we can add another layer for smoothing with `stat_smooth()`.

```{r lec02_plt6, error=TRUE}
# this doesn't work as stat_smooth didn't know aes(x , y)
ggplot(data = gm_dt) + 
  geom_point(aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp)) +
  stat_smooth()

# this would work but too rebundant
ggplot(data = gm_dt) + 
  geom_point(aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp)) +
  stat_smooth(aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp))


# the common aes(x, y) shared by all the layers can be put in the ggplot()
ggplot(data = gm_dt, aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp, color=continent)) + 
  geom_point(aes(size=pop)) +
  stat_smooth()
```


### Facets, axes and labels

For comparing the data from the year 1977 with the data from 2007, we can add a facet with `facet_wrap()`:

```{r}
ggplot(data = gm_dt, aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp, color=continent, size=pop)) + 
  geom_point() + facet_wrap(~year)
```


For a better visualization of the data points, we can consider log scaling, which we will describe more in detail later. Finally, we can adapt the axis labels of the plot with `labs()` and define the theme of our plot:

```{r}
mysize <- 15
mytheme <- theme(
    axis.title = element_text(size=mysize), 
    axis.text = element_text(size=mysize),
    legend.title = element_text(size=mysize),
    legend.text = element_text(size=mysize)
    ) + theme_bw()

ggplot(data=gm_dt, aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp)) + geom_point(aes(color=continent, size=pop)) +
  facet_grid(~year) + scale_x_log10() +
  labs(x="Life expectation at birth", y="per-capita GDP") + mytheme
```

We remark here that `ggplot2` allows many further adaptions to plots, such as specifying axis breaks and limits. Some of these are covered in the appendix at the end of this script.

<!--   geom_point(aes(CPI, HDI, shape = region)) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Aesthetic mappings can also be supplied in individual layers. For example, directly in the `geom_point` layer: -->

<!-- ```{r lec02_plt11} -->
<!-- ggplot(ind, aes(CPI, HDI)) +  -->
<!--   geom_point(aes(color = region)) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ### Scales and labels -->

## Different types of one- and two-dimensional plots 

In the previous examples, we had a look at scatter plots which are suitable for plotting the relationship between two continuous variables. However, there are many more types of plots (e.g. histograms, boxplots) which can be used for plotting in different scenarios. Mainly, we differentiate between plotting one or two variables and whether the variables are continuous or discrete. 

### Plots for one single continuous variable

#### Histograms

A histogram represents the frequencies of values of a variable bucketed into ranges. It takes as input numeric variables only. A histogram is similar to a bar plot but the difference is that it groups the values into continuous ranges. Each bar in a histogram represents the height of the number of values present in that range. Each bar of the histogram is called a bin.

We can construct a histogram of Human Development Index (HDI) in the ind dataset with the function `geom_histogram()`:

```{r lec03_hist1, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(ind, aes(HDI)) + geom_histogram() + mytheme
```

By default, the number of bins in `ggplot2` is 30. We can simply change this by defining the number of desired bins in the `bins` argument of the `geom_histogram()` function:

```{r lec03_hist2, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(ind, aes(HDI)) + geom_histogram(bins=10) + mytheme
```

#### Density plots

Histograms are sometimes not optimal to investigate the distribution of a variable due to discretization effects during the binning process. A variation of histograms is given by density plots. They are used to represent the distribution of a numeric variable. These distribution plots are typically obtained by kernel density estimation to smoothen out the noise. Thus, the plots are smooth across bins and are not affected by the number of bins created, which helps create a more defined distribution shape. 

As an example, we can visualize the distribution of Human Development Index (HDI) in the ind dataset by means of a density plot with `geom_density()`:

```{r lec03_density1, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(ind, aes(HDI)) + geom_density() + mytheme
```

Using the `bw` argument of the `geom_density()` function allows to tweak the bandwidth of a density plot manually. The default option is a bandwidth rule, which is usually a good choice.

Setting a small bandwidth on the previous plot has a huge impact on the plot:

```{r lec03_hist3}
ggplot(ind, aes(HDI)) + geom_density(bw=0.01) +
  mytheme
```

Setting a large bandwidth has also a huge impact on the plot:

```{r lec03_density2}
ggplot(ind, aes(HDI)) + geom_density(bw=1) +
  mytheme
```

Thus, we should be careful when changing the bandwidth, since we can get a wrong impression from the distribution of a continuous variable.

#### Boxplots

Box plots can give a good graphical insight into the distribution of the data. They show how far the extreme values are from most of the data.

Five values are essential for constructing a boxplot:

* the median: the center of the data, middle value in sorted list, 50% quantile of the data
* the first quantile (Q1):  25% quantile of the data
* the third quantile (Q3): 75% quantile of the data
* the interquantile range (IQR): the distance between Q1 and Q3

Every boxplot has lines at Q1, the median and Q3, which build the box of the boxplot. The other major feature of a boxplot is its whiskers. The whiskers are determined with the help of the IQR. Here, we compute 1.5 × IQR below Q1 and 1.5 × IQR above Q3. Anything outside of this range is called an outlier. We then draw lines at the smallest and largest point within this subset (Q1 - 1.5 × IQR to Q3 + 1.5 × IQR) from the dataset. These lines define our whiskers which reach the most extreme data point within $\pm  1.5\times IQR$.

<!-- <img src="./assets/img/lec06_07_plotting/lec06_Boxplot_vs_PDF.png" width="400"> -->
```{r, out.width = "400px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/img/lec06_07_plotting/lec06_Boxplot_vs_PDF.png")
```

It is possible to not show the outliers in boxplots, as seen in the visualization before. However, we strongly recommend keeping them. Outliers can reveal interesting data points (discoveries "out of the box") or bugs in data preprocessing. 

```{r, out.width = "400px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/img/lec05-box_explained.png")
```

For instance, we can plot the distribution of a variable `x` with a histogram and visualize the corresponding boxplot:

```{r lec05_boxplot1,  echo=F, out.width='150px', out.height='700px', fig.height = 5, fig.width = 4}
set.seed(0)
xl <- c(0,5)
par(mfrow=c(1,2), mar=c(2,2,2,2)) 
dt <- data.table(x=rlnorm(1000,meanlog=0,sdlog=0.5), group='x')
p1 <- ggplot(dt, aes(x)) + geom_histogram(bins=30) + mytheme
p2 <- ggplot(dt, aes(group, x)) + geom_boxplot() + coord_flip() + mytheme
grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol=1)
```

Boxplots are particularly suited for plotting non-gaussian symmetric and non-symmetric data and for plotting exponentially distributed data. However, boxplots are not well suited for bimodal data, since they only show one mode (the median). In the following example, we see a bimodal distribution in the histogram and the corresponding boxplot, which does not properly represent the distribution of the data. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
set.seed(100)
```
```{r lec05_boxplot3,  echo=FALSE, out.width=c('220px', '220px'), fig.show='hold'}
x = c(rnorm(100,1), rnorm(100,1)+5)
hist(x)
boxplot(x)
```

### Plots for two variables: one continuous, one discrete

#### Boxplots by category

As illustrated before, boxplots are well suited for plotting one continuous variable. However, we can also use boxplots to show distributions of continuous variables with respect to some categories. This can be particularly interesting for comparing the different distributions of each category.

For instance, we want to visualize the highway miles per gallon `hwy` for every	one of the 7 vehicle classes	(compact, SUV, minivan, etc.). For this, we define the categorical `class` variable on the `x` axis and the continuous variable `hwy` on the `y` axis. 

```{r lec05_boxplot4}
ggplot(mpg, aes(class, hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot() + mytheme
```

#### Violinplots 

A violin plot is an alternative to the boxplot for visualizing either one continuous variable (grouped by categories). An advantage of the violin plot over the boxplot is that it also shows the entire distribution of the data. This can be particularly interesting when dealing with multimodal data. 

For a direct comparison, we show a violinplot for the `hwy` grouped by `class` as before with the help of the function `geom_violin()`:

```{r lec05_boxplot5}
ggplot(mpg, aes(class, hwy)) +
  geom_violin() + mytheme
```

#### Beanplots 

Another alternative to the popular boxplot is the beanplot. In a beanplot, the individual observations are shown as small lines in a one-dimensional scatter plot. Moreover, the estimated density of the distributions is visible in a beanplot. It is easy to compare different groups of data in a beanplot and to see if a group contains enough observations to make the group interesting from a statistical point of view. 

For creating beanplots in R, we can use the package `ggbeeswarm`. We can use the function `geom_besswarm()` to create a beanplot visualize once again the `hwy` grouped by `class`: 

```{r lec05_beeswarm}
# install.packages("ggbeeswarm")
library(ggbeeswarm)
ggplot(mpg, aes(class, hwy)) + 
  geom_beeswarm() + mytheme
```

We remark that beanplots are useful only up to a certain number of data points. The creation of beanplots for larger datasets may become too expensive.

#### Barplots

Barplots are often used to highlight individual quantitative values per category. Bars are visual heavyweights compared to dots and lines. In a barplot, we can combine two attributes of 2-D location and line length to encode quantitative values. In this manner, we can focus the attention primarily on individual values and support the comparison of one to another.

For creating a simple barplot with `ggplot2` we can use the function `geom_bar()`. In the next example, we visualize the number of countries (defined in the `y` axis) per continent (defined in the `x` axis).

```{r, echo = F}
countries_dt <- data.table(Continent = c("North America", "South America",
                                         "Africa", "Asia", "Europe", "Oceania"), 
                           Number_countries = c(23, 12, 54, 49, 50, 16))
```

```{r, lec05_coun}
ggplot(countries_dt, aes(Continent, Number_countries)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', width = .7) + mytheme
```

#### Barplots with errorbars

Visualizing uncertainty is important, otherwise, barplots with bars as a result of an aggregation can be misleading. One way to visualize uncertainty is with error bars.

As error bars, we can consider the standard deviation (SD) and the standard error of the mean (SEM). We remark that SD and SEM are completely different concepts. On the one hand, SD indicates the variation of quantity in the sample. On the other hand, SEM represents how well the mean is estimated.
  
The central limit theorem implies that: $SEM = SD / \sqrt{(n)}$ , where $n$ is the sample size (number of observations). With large $n$, SEM tends to 0.

In the following example, we plot me average highway miles per gallon `hwy` per vehicle class `class` including error bars computed as the average plus/minus standard devation of `hwy`: 

```{r lec05_erb}
as.data.table(mpg) %>% 
  .[, .(mean = mean(hwy),
        sd = sd(hwy)),
    by = class] %>% 
  ggplot(aes(class, mean, ymax=mean+sd, ymin=mean-sd)) + 
  geom_bar(stat='identity') +
  geom_errorbar(width = 0.3) + mytheme
```

### Plots for two continuos variables

#### Scatter plots

Scatter plots are a useful plot type for easily visualizing the relationship between two continuous variables. Here, dots are used to represent pairs of values corresponding to the two considered variables. The position of each dot on the horizontal (`x`) and vertical (`y`) axis indicates values for an individual data point.

In the next example, we analyze the relationship between the engine displacement in liters `displ` and the highway miles per gallon `hwy` from the `mpg` dataset: 

```{r lec05_point1}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + geom_point() + mytheme
```

We slightly modify the previous plot by coloring the points depending on the vehicle class:

```{r lec05_point2}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, color=class)) + geom_point() + mytheme
```

Sometimes, too many colors can hard to distinguish. In such cases, we can use `facet` to separate them into different plots:

```{r lec05_point22, out.width='600px', fig.height = 3, fig.width = 5}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~class) + mytheme
```

##### Text labeling

For labeling the individual points in a scatter plot, `ggplot2` offers the function `geom_text()`. However, these labels tend to overlap. To avoid this, we can use the library `ggrepel` which offers a better text labeling with the help of the function `geom_text_repel()`.

We first show the output of the classic text labeling with `geom_text()` for a random subset of 40 observations of the dataset `mpg`. here we plot the engine displacement in liters `displ` vs. the highway miles per gallon `hwy` and label by `manufacturer`: 

```{r lec05_point11}
set.seed(12)
mpg_subset <- mpg[sample(1:nrow(mpg), 30, replace=FALSE),] 
ggplot(mpg_subset, aes(displ, hwy, label=manufacturer)) + geom_point() +
  geom_text() + mytheme
```



As seen in the previous illustration, the text labels overlap. This difficults an appropriate understanding of the plot. Therefore, we exchange the function `geom_text()` by `geom_text_repel()` from the library `ggrepel`:

```{r lec05_point111}
library(ggrepel)

ggplot(mpg_subset, aes(displ, hwy, label=manufacturer)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_text_repel() + mytheme
```



##### Log scaling

We can consider a different example where we want to plot brain and body weights of the dataset `Animals`. This is what we obtain after creating a simple scatterplot.

```{r}
library(MASS) # to access Animals data sets
animals_dt <- as.data.table(Animals)

ggplot(animals_dt, aes(x = body, y = brain)) + geom_point() + mytheme
```

We can clearly see that there are a few points which are notably larger than most of the points. This makes it harder to interpret the relationships between most of these points. In such cases, we can consider **logarithmic** transformations and/or scaling. More precisely, a first idea would be to manually transform the values into a logarithmic space and plot the transformed values instead of the original values:

```{r}
animals_dt[, c('log_body', 'log_brain') := list(log10(body), log10(brain)) ]

ggplot(animals_dt, aes(x = log_body, y = log_brain)) + geom_point() + mytheme
```

Alternativelt, `ggplot2` offers to simply scale the data without the need to transform. This can be done with the help of the functions `scale_x_log10()` and `scale_y_log10()` which allow appropriate scaling and labeling of the axes:

```{r}
ggplot(animals_dt, aes(x = body, y = brain)) + geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() + scale_y_log10() + mytheme
```

#### Density plots in 2D

Using scatterplots can become problematic when dealing with a huge number of points. This is due to the fact that points may overlap and we cannot clearly see how many points overlap at a certain position. In such cases, a 2D density plot is particularly well suited. This plot counts the number of observations within a particular area of the 2D space.

The function `geom_hex()` is particularly useful for creating 2D density plots in R:

```{r lec05_hex}
x <- rnorm(10000); y=x+rnorm(10000)
data.table(x, y) %>% ggplot(aes(x, y)) +
  geom_hex() + mytheme
```

#### Line plots


A line plot can be considered for connecting a series of individual data points or to display the trend of a series of data points.
This can be particularly interesting to show the shape of data as it flows and changes from point to point. We can also show the strength of the movement of values up and down through time. 

As an example we show the connection between the individual datapoints of unemployment rate over the years:

```{r lec05_line}
ggplot(economics, aes(date, unemploy / pop)) +
  geom_line() + mytheme
```



## Further plots for low dimensional data

### Plot matrix

A so-termed plot matrix is useful for exploring the distributions and correlations of a few variables in a matrix-like representation. Here, for each pair of considered variables, a scatterplot is created and the correlation coefficient is computed. For every single variable, a histogram is created for showing the respective distribution. 

We can use the function `ggpairs()` from the library `GGally` for constructing plot matrices. As an example, we analyze the variables `displ`, `cyl`, `cty` and `hwy`from the dataset `mpg`:

```{r lec04_ggpairs}
library(GGally)
ggpairs(mpg, columns = c("displ","cyl","cty","hwy")) + mytheme
```

We remark that this plot is not well suited for comparing more than a few variables.

### Correlation plot

A correlation plot is a graph of the correlation matrix. It is useful to highlight the most correlated variables in a dataset. In this plot, correlation coefficients are colored according to the value. A correlation matrix can be also reordered according to the degree of association between variables.

Correlation plots are also called "corrgrams" or "correlograms". As an example, we visualize the correlation between the variables of the dataset `mtcars` with the help of the function `ggcorr()` from the library `GGally`:

```{r lec04_corplot}
ggcorr(mtcars, geom = 'circle') 
```


## Summary

This first chapter of data visualization covered the basics of the grammar of graphics and `ggplot2` to plot low dimensional data. We introduced the different types of plots such as histograms, boxplots and barplots and discussed when to use which plot.
